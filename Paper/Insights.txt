The original data have a large amount of variance to the point where firther analysis is difficult. We can say with certainty that there must be some enormous outliers on the right side of the sale prices, since the histogram is extremely skewed to the right and the mean and median are nowehere close to the mode, and the max value is much larger than the difference from the 3rd quartile and the median. The plot further confirms this as all the data are clustered in the lower-left corner.

Taking the base 10 logs helps mitigate the effect of the outliers and we start to see a loosely linear correlation between square footage and sale price. Once the outliers are removed the plot appears to show a much better linear correlation between sale price and gross square footage, though still with some points that seem to ignore the trend (exceptional cases, not outliers). The histogram appears much better though still heavily skewed to the right. This makes sense given that we are working with houses and expensive outliers shoudl be expected to some degree in a dataset.
